Amazon Omics is a suite of cloud-based tools and resources that allow users to perform high-performance computing in the field of genomics. It simplifies and accelerates storing and analyzing genomic information for research and clinical organizations and makes scientific discovery and insight generation faster.

Omics has three primary components:

- **Omics Storage** helps you store and share petabytes of genomics data efficiently and at low cost per gigabase.
- **Omics Analytics** simplifies how you prepare genomics data for multiomics and multimodal analyses.
- **Omics Workflows** automatically provisions and scales the underlying infrastructure for your bioinformatics computation.

This workshop focuses primarily on the use of Omics Workflows. Omics Workflows minimizes the need for bioinformaticians to manage complicated server infrastructure, allowing them to focus on the protein folding task at hand.
