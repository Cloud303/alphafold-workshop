# Overview

In this workshop, we will learn two methods of running AlphaFold using Amazon Omics. 

First, we will run AlphaFold using Ready2Run workflows. Then we will run protein folding through a pipeline provided by the [nf-core project](https://nf-co.re/) and demonstrate how this approach provides us with advanced customization capabilities.
