The nf-core project is a community-driven effort to establish a set of analysis pipelines that are shared across researchers and institutions. The nf-core pipelines are built using Nextflow and Docker, and are designed to be portable, scalable, and reproducible. By using nf-core pipelines, researchers can avoid spending time building and optimizing their own pipelines, and can instead focus on analyzing their data and interpreting their results.

Unlike Ready2Run workflows, nf-core workflows are completely open-source. This provides us the ability to start from a stable, community-vetted pipeline, and add our own customizations on top of it.
