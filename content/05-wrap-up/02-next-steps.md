Here are two other approaches for protein folding on AWS, and links to learn more:

* [AWS Batch Architecture for Protein Folding and Design](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/aws-batch-arch-for-protein-folding) offers a quickstart solution for running protein folding on AWS Batch.
* [Healthcare and Life Sciences Amazon SageMaker and AI/ML Immersion Day Workshops](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-healthcare-lifescience-ai-ml-sample-notebooks) shows how to run ESMFold via SageMaker notebooks
