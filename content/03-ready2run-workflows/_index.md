# Ready2Run Workflows

In this chapter we will learn about Ready2Run workflows and how to use them to run simple AlphaFold workflows.

Ready2Run workflows are a set of pre-built workflows from third-party software companies and open-source pipelines. With just a few clicks or a single API call, customers can run pre-built pipelines to perform primary analysis such as converting base calls to FASTQ files, secondary analysis such as gene expression or variant calling, and tertiary analysis such as protein structure prediction. Ready2Run workflows are priced-per-run to give customers predictable pricing.
