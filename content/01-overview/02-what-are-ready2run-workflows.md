Ready2Run workflows are a set of pre-built workflows from third-party software companies and open-source pipelines. Ready2Run workflows might be open source workflows such as nf-core or GATK best practices, or they might be subscription-based.

With just a few clicks or a single API call, customers can run pre-built pipelines to perform primary analysis such as converting base calls to FASTQ files, secondary analysis such as gene expression or variant calling, and tertiary analysis such as protein structure prediction.

One important benefit of Ready2Run workflows is predictable pricing. By establishing input guardrails, AWS can price the workflows per run. Predictable pricing like this is not possible with custom workflows because the infrastructure and runtime requirements depend on user-provided content.

Ready2Run workflows are a great option whenever the user would like to run a common form of analysis quickly without advanced configuration options.
