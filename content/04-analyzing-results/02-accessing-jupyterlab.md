In order to access SageMaker Notebook instance, you need to:

1. Logon to the AWS Console.
2. Browse to the Amazon SageMaker Notebook Instances Console.
3. Open JupyterLab.

Once you access JupyterLab, you will see a notebook named `visualize-pdb-alphafold-3d-structure.ipynb`. Open it, and follow the instructions to produce a variety of analytics and visualizations.

The PDB file can also be opened using other visualization software. The following picture was generated using the [Protein Viewer VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ArianJamasb.protein-viewer).
