## Why use Ready2Run Workflows?

Ready2Run Workflows can be a very convenient way to run common 3rd party solutions quickly. Additionally Ready2Run workflows offer predictable pricing, which further simplifies the process.

At the time of writing, Ready2Run workflows offers 3 protein folding algorithms. Two Alphafold workflows supporting different numbers of residues, and an ESMFold workflow. 

## How did we analyze the protein folding results?

While there are many ways to analyze the results of a protein folding job, this workshop focused on using SageMaker notebooks. A variety of Python packages were used in the process, including biopython, nglview, MDAnalysis, py3Dmol, and biopandas.
